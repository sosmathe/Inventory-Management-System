# Inventory-Management-System
The project entails building a Python program, "inventory.py," to process data from "inventory.txt." It features a `Shoe` class with a `read_data()` function using a try-except block to extract attributes like country, code, product, cost, and quantity. The program creates a list of shoe objects and enables product search by code. It further identifies the lowest-quantity product for restocking and the highest-quantity product for sale. A `value_per_item()` function calculates the value of each item (value = cost * quantity) and adds a "value" column to the data. The program utilizes Python's `tabulate` module to represent object data in a table format, enhancing data presentation.

In essence, the project offers an automated approach to inventory management. By extracting, processing, and analyzing data from the text file, it generates meaningful insights such as restocking priorities and potential sales opportunities. The program's structured organization and utilization of classes demonstrate effective object-oriented programming. Additionally, the integration of the `tabulate` module enhances data visualization, facilitating clearer communication of inventory details to managers. This project effectively combines data handling, calculation, and visualization to streamline inventory analysis and presentation for managerial decision-making.
